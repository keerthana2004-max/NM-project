Abstract:
    Speech-to-Text (STT) technology enables the automatic conversion of spoken language into written text using advanced algorithms and machine learning models. This process involves capturing audio input, preprocessing the signal, extracting relevant features, and decoding them into text using acoustic and language models. STT systems have seen significant advancements with the integration of deep learning, particularly through the use of neural networks such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformer-based architectures. Applications of STT include virtual assistants, real-time transcription services, voice-controlled interfaces, and accessibility tools for individuals with disabilities. This paper explores the architecture, techniques, and challenges in developing accurate and efficient STT systems, emphasizing their role in enhancing human-computer interaction and accessibility.
